This is an implementation of a on-chip network router.

Some features of this design:

1. Flit-based wormhole flow control with configurable virtual channels
2. Using credit-based traffic throttling
3. Routing with simple X-first schemes
4. 2-stage pipelining, removing virtual channel allocation with virtual channel selection
